# PaperWasteManagement


## Description

The objective was to design an automated paper shredder to overcome with the complex hand operated paper shredders. Paper shredder machine is a mechanical device which is used to cut the paper into strips or fine particles. We have planned this project model for recycling of paper wastage(important documents, personal information like social security number, account number, credit card application and other personal information) in domestic area, industrial area etc. The shredder was designed in such a way that it was made to operate automatically using sensors and a microcontroller. Where the sensors can sense the presence of paper and sends instructions to the microcontroller.
